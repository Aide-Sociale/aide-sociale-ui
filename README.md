Installing
==========

System dependencies
-------------------

### Ubuntu

Make sure `build-essential`, `mongodb`, `node` v0.10, `grunt` and `bower` are installed on your machine

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install mongodb
```

### For all platforms

The runtime is Node 0.10.

You can for example use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install this specific version.

Once you have Node and npm installed, run:

```sh
npm install --global grunt-cli bower
```


Application
-----------

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sgmap/mes-aides-ui.git
cd mes-aides-ui
npm install
bower install
grunt build
```

### Development mode

If you need to add features to the API, the best is to [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) `sgmap/mes-aides-api` into `mes-aides-ui`, to avoid depending on the published version.


Usage
-----

First, start a Mongo server:

```sh
mongod --dbpath db
```

Then, start the server:

```sh
npm start
```

or if you want to use grunt (with livereload), you can start it with :

```sh
grunt serve
```

If you like TDD, you will probably enjoy this command which will run the tests each time a file in the tests/ folder is modified :

```sh
grunt watch
```


Testing
=======

There are several levels of tests. You can safely use `npm test` to drive your developments.

- Syntax tests are executed with `grunt jshint`.
- Unit tests are executed with `grunt test`.

Integration tests are executed in a more convoluted way.

We use [Ludwig](https://github.com/sgmap/ludwig-ui) to help users create integration tests. These tests have to be fetched and loaded in your local database so you can execute them on your development machine.
To do so, use the `import-tests.sh` script at the root of the repository. You will need to have a running Mongo database, and SSH access to the production server.
